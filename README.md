  Hello there, This is my repository for all my Javascript projects!
# Projects
  Calculator- Using Javascript and HTML I programmed a calculator that can run on your browser and preform basic math operations and styled it using some CSS. 
  Pizza Project - Created a Pizza ordering application using JS, HTML, CSS that is capable of letting a user build there pizza with toppings and sizes and JS calculates the total   price for order. 
  TicTacToe Project - Built a TicTacToe game that let you play against the computer. I used HTML and CSS to build the interface. I used images and audio effects for the game         elements and used Javascript to implement the bahavior of a player storing possible win conditions and keeping track of turns. The Javascript interacts with my HTML canvas         elements allowing the user to keep playing round after round.
